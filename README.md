This module is created to easily export and import VBA code to `./src` directory. This gives the ability to then use Git to version control your VBA ðŸŽ‰!

This is needed as Git can't read Excel files directly, but can read the source files that are exported.

> Added bonus, there is a `Bash` function to run commands directly within the Immediate window. Example `Project.bash "git add . && git commit -m ""Yay, from VBA"""

## Goal of the project

- Create an easy way to integrage git version control with VBA.
- Create continuous integration for VBA Projects.

## Progress

- [x] Write code to export VBComponents to source directory.
- [x] Write code to import VBComponents from source directory.
- [ ] Create a testing workflow for continuous integration/deployment.

## Getting Started

First make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system.

1. import `Project.bas` into your project.
1. Set a reference to `Microsoft Visual Basic For Applications Extensibility 5.3` and `Microsoft Scripting Runtime`
1. In the immediate widow type `Project.InitializeProject`. This will create a gitignore file and run `git init`.
1. Run `Project.ExportComponentsToSourceFolder` manually, or even better add it to the `ThisWorkbook.Workbook_AfterSave` event, so that it runs after every save.

That's it! Version control can now be managed easily with VBA.
